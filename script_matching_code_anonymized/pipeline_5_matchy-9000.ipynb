    "### AI Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the instructions currently being provided to the API. They were drafted with the intent to guide the API in evaluating the alignment between internship applicants and specific job descriptions. However, these instructions should undergo an iterative process of improvement to enhance their effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Referencing**: \n",
    "   - One of the critical elements of these instructions is the emphasis on referencing. By including explicit instructions on how to reference the information, we can minimize hallucinations and ensure that the AI generates responses that are grounded in the provided data. \n",
    "   - The use of references, such as line numbers from both student profiles and job descriptions, helps maintain traceability and transparency in the AI's responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Numbering Lines**:\n",
    "   - I have found that numbering each line of the information provided to the AI is an effective method for enabling accurate referencing. This approach ensures that the AI can precisely identify and relate specific details from the input data to the task at hand.\n",
    "   - Currently, the text being sent to the AI does not include numbered lines. It would be beneficial to refine the function that prepares the text to incorporate line numbering. This refinement would further enhance the accuracy of the AI's referencing and reduce the risk of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterative Improvement**: The instructions should be regularly reviewed and updated based on feedback and results. This will help identify areas where the AI's performance can be enhanced and ensure that the instructions remain aligned with the project's goals.\n",
    "- **Implementing Line Numbering**: Refining the function that prepares the text to include line numbers is a recommended next step. This will improve the AI's ability to reference information accurately and reduce the potential for generating content that is not directly tied to the provided data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these recommendations, the instructions can be made more robust, leading to more accurate and reliable outcomes from the AI."

    "Your task is to see how well internship applicants align with a specific job. I will be sending you different student profiles (which include essays, resumes, and other information about the student), and job descriptions.

    "  - For information from the student profile, label it as (SP line #).\n",
    "  - For information from the job description, label it as (JD line #).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of referencing:\n",
    "1. If a student profile on line 5 states, \"5. I am good with SQL,\" and the job description on line 17 mentions, \"17. We need someone who knows SQL\":\n",
    "   - *Output:* \"The student's knowledge of SQL (SP line 5) aligns well with the job's requirement for someone skilled in this area (JD line 17).\"\n",
    "2. If a student profile expresses a strong preference for working in the beauty industry, saying on line 3, \"3. I really only want to work in the beauty industry.\", and the job description indicates the job is in the accounting industry on line 19 by stating, \"19. This job is in the accounting industry.\":\n",

    "## Matchy-9000: Automated Student-Job Profile Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script is designed to process and align student profiles with job descriptions using an AI-based scoring mechanism. The alignment process is broken down into several stages, including token estimation, batch processing, and result aggregation. The following description outlines the key components and functions used in this script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Loading and Combining DataFrames**\n",
    "   - **Function:** `load_and_combine_saved_dfs(timeout_dir, base_filename)`\n",
    "   - **Description:** This function loads all previously saved DataFrames from a specified directory and combines them into a single DataFrame. It is useful for recovering progress from temporary files in case of a timeout or interruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Restarting the Processing**\n",
    "   - **Function:** `restart_processing(dataframe, pbar, timeout_dir, periodic_save_dir, base_filename, assistant_id, batch, num_in_batch)`\n",
    "   - **Description:** This function restarts the processing of profiles by loading previously saved progress and marking already processed rows. It is useful for resuming work after an interruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Saving Temporary DataFrame**\n",
    "   - **Function:** `save_temp_dataframe(dataframe, timeout_dir, base_filename)`\n",
    "   - **Description:** This function saves the processed rows of the DataFrame to a temporary file in case of a timeout. This helps preserve progress so that processing can be resumed from the last saved state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Extracting Alignment Scores**\n",
    "   - **Function:** `get_alignment_score(alignment_text)`\n",
    "   - **Description:** This function extracts and returns the alignment scores from the alignment text generated by the assistant. It parses the alignment text to identify scores for different categories and compiles them into a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Replenishing Rate and Token Limits**\n",
    "   - **Functions:** `replenish_rps()` and `replenish_tps()`\n",
    "   - **Description:** These functions continuously replenish the rate and token limit semaphores to allow more requests and tokens per second to be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Sending and Receiving Data from the Assistant**\n",
    "   - **Function:** `matchy(formatted_profile, assistant_id, row)`\n",
    "   - **Description:** This function sends a formatted profile to the assistant for processing, handles rate limits and retries, and returns the alignment text and token usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Cleaning Text for Processing**\n",
    "   - **Function:** `clean_text(row)`\n",
    "   - **Description:** This function formats the text from a row of the DataFrame into a structured string that combines position and applicant profile information. The formatted text is used later for alignment scoring and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Processing a Single Profile**\n",
    "   - **Function:** `process_batch(row, assistant_id, id_column)`\n",
    "   - **Description:** This function processes a single profile by cleaning the text, sending it for alignment scoring, and then extracting and returning the relevant alignment scores and token usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Batch Processing of Profiles**\n",
    "   - **Function:** `send_and_recive_batch(dataframe, pbar, periodic_save_dir, base_filename, assistant_id, batch, batch_completed, num_in_batch)`\n",
    "   - **Description:** This function processes a batch of student profiles using concurrent threads, updates the DataFrame with the results, and handles periodic saving. It manages threading for batch processing and updates the progress bar as profiles are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Preparing and Managing Batches**\n",
    "   - **Function:** `prep_batch(dataframe, pbar, timeout_dir, periodic_save_dir, base_filename, assistant_id, batch, num_in_batch)`\n",
    "   - **Description:** Prepares and processes a batch of student profiles by setting up countdown and timeout mechanisms. Manages the timing of batches and handles potential timeouts during batch processing.\n",

While their experience is primarily within retail, their skills in social media management and collaborative teamwork align with the company's community focus.

However, there are noticeable gaps in direct experience related to the media industry and community-focused marketing tasks.
