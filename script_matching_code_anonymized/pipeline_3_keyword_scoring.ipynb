    "<h3>Pipeline Stage 3: Keyword Scoring</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Welcome to stage 3 of the pipeline! In this stage, we will leverage the keywords extracted in Pipeline 2 to score and match students to job opportunities. By utilizing both keyword matches and the labels assigned during extraction, we can create a more nuanced and sophisticated matching system. Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy matching to capture relevant connections between students and jobs, even when exact keyword matches are not present.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The scoring criteria employed in this stage are somewhat arbitrary and should be revisited for refinement. The approach mirrors the existing scoring system but introduces the use of labels and distinct categories to enhance the process. Specifically, technical skills and industry alignment are given the highest weight in the scoring system, reflecting their critical importance to employers. In contrast, soft skills and value alignment are weighted lower, serving as supplementary factors that can elevate a candidateâ€™s standing if they already meet the primary qualifications.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>My rationale is that companies prioritize technical skills and industry alignment when evaluating candidates, as these are the most directly related to job performance. On the other hand, soft skills and value alignment, while important, are viewed as additional strengths that can differentiate candidates who are already technically qualified. This weighted approach aims to provide a balanced and effective matching process, ensuring that the most qualified candidates are paired with the most suitable job opportunities.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "</p>The scoring process is not parallelized or optimized for speed and currently takes some time to complete (around a minute). If you'd prefer to skip the scoring process, a pre-scored table is available in the final results section.</p>\n"
