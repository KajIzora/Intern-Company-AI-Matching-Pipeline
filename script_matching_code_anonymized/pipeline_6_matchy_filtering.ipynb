    "### Summary of the Matching Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a similar strategy used in pipeline 4 when filtering based on keyword scores. This code implements an iterative matching strategy designed to ensure that each student is matched with no more than 5 companies, while prioritizing the highest alignment scores (`Extraction_total_points`) between students and companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Steps in the Matching Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Sorting:**\n",
    "   - The DataFrame `SP` is sorted by `pos_(Do Not Modify) Job Posting` and `Extraction_total_points` in descending order. This ensures that for each company, the top matches (with the highest alignment scores) are prioritized.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Matching Rounds:**\n",
    "   - The matching process is conducted in multiple rounds. In each round, the top match for each company is selected from the remaining pool of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Processing Top Matches:**\n",
    "   - For each company in a given round, the top match (the student with the highest alignment score for that company) is identified and collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tracking Student Matches:**\n",
    "   - The code maintains a dictionary (`student_matches`) that tracks all the matches for each student across all rounds.\n",
    "   - After collecting new matches for the current round, the code ensures that each student retains only their top 2 matches based on `Overall Alignment Score`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Updating Final Matches:**\n",
    "   - The selected matches (limited to the top 5 for each student) are added to the `final_matches` DataFrame, which accumulates all the valid matches throughout the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Removing Fully Matched Students:**\n",
    "   - Students who have reached their maximum of 2 matches are removed from the pool (`SP_sorted`). This ensures they are not considered in subsequent rounds, preventing over-matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Loop Termination:**\n",
    "   - The loop continues until no students are left in the pool (`SP_sorted.empty`), meaning all students have either reached their maximum matches or no suitable matches remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Counting Rounds:**\n",
    "   - The variable `num_rounds` tracks the number of iterations (rounds) needed to complete the matching process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "- The final output is a DataFrame `final_matches` that contains all the matches, limited to the top 2 matches per student, ensuring an optimal distribution based on alignment scores.\n",
    "- Additionally, the number of rounds taken to complete the matching process is printed, providing insight into the efficiency of the matching strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics of the Strategy:\n",
    "- **Prioritization of Top Matches:** The strategy consistently prioritizes the highest alignment scores for each company, ensuring that the best possible matches are made.\n",
    "- **Controlled Match Distribution:** By limiting each student to a maximum of 2 matches, the strategy prevents any student from being over-matched, ensuring a fair distribution across all companies.\n",
    "- **Iterative Approach:** The iterative nature of the strategy allows for flexibility, as it continuously re-evaluates and refines the matches until an optimal solution is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is efficient and ensures that the most aligned matches are prioritized while adhering to the constraint that no student is matched with more than 5 companies."

This means that as the total points increase, the overall alignment score tends to increase slightly, but the relationship is not strong.\n",

    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "The analysis suggests that while there is some relationship between total points and overall alignment score, the weak correlation and the low slope of the regression line indicate that **total points may not be a strong predictor of overall alignment score**. Therefore, it may not be the most effective metric for evaluating the quality of matches in this context.
